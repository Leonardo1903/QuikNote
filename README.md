## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   An **[Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) account** (you can use the free Appwrite Cloud tier).

### 1. Set up Your Appwrite Backend

Before running the app, you need to configure your Appwrite project.

1.  Go to your [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io/) and create a new project.
2.  **Create a Database**: Navigate to the "Databases" tab and create a new database.
3.  **Create a Collection**: Inside your new database, create a collection to store the notes. You will need to define attributes for your notes (e.g., `title`, `content`, `user_id`).
4.  **Find Your IDs**: Keep the following IDs handy:
    -   Your **Project ID** (from Settings)
    -   Your **Database ID** (from the Databases tab)
    -   Your **Collection ID** (from the collection you just created)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

1.  In the root directory of the project, create a new file named `.env`.
2.  Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if available) or add the following variables, replacing the placeholders with your actual Appwrite IDs.

    ```env
    VITE_APPWRITE_URL="[https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1](https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1)"
    VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID="YOUR_DATABASE_ID"
    VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID="YOUR_COLLECTION_ID"
    ```
    *Note: The `VITE_APPWRITE_URL` is typically the one shown above for Appwrite Cloud.*

### 3. Install and Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Leonardo1903/QuikNote.git](https://github.com/Leonardo1903/QuikNote.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd QuikNote
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the URL provided) in your browser to see the application.
